In this project, I used Logistic Regression and XGBoost to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Each algorithm has its own advantages,
making them suitable for different scenarios.

ðŸ”¹ Logistic Regression:

A simple and interpretable model that provides probability scores for fraud detection.
Works well on linearly separable data and is computationally efficient.
Less prone to overfitting, making it a good baseline model.

ðŸ”¹ XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting):
A powerful ensemble learning algorithm that captures complex patterns.
Works well with nonlinear relationships and handles large datasets effectively.
Uses boosting to improve performance by minimizing errors iteratively.

 Comparison:
Logistic Regression is faster and easier to interpret, making it ideal for real-time applications where explainability is important.
XGBoost provides higher accuracy by learning complex fraud patterns, but it requires more computational power and tuning.
